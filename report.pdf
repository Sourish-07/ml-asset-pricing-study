Abstract
This paper evaluates the predictability of daily U.S. equity returns using machine learning models applied to a 
large scale panel of stock price data. Using lagged returns and volatility based features, 
I assess whether nonlinear models provide meaningful improvements over linear benchmarks. 
Results show limited out of sample predictability, consistent with existing asset pricing literature, 
highlighting the challenges of short horizon return forecasting.

Data
The dataset consists of daily price observations for U.S. equities spanning multiple decades. 
Raw price files were cleaned and aggregated into a unified panel containing over fourteen million observations. 
Daily returns were computed at the individual stock level.

Feature Construction
For each stock, I constructed lagged daily returns at one, five, and twenty day horizons. 
Rolling twenty day return volatility was also included to capture time varying risk. 
Observations with insufficient history were removed to ensure consistent feature availability.

Methodology
I evaluated two models. A linear regression model was used as a baseline to assess linear predictability. 
A random forest model was used to capture nonlinear relationships between lagged returns and volatility. 
Models were evaluated using out of sample mean squared error and R squared.

Results
Both models produced negative out of sample R squared values. 
The random forest reduced prediction error relative to the linear benchmark but did not achieve positive 
explanatory power. These findings are consistent with prior research demonstrating the difficulty of 
predicting short horizon stock returns.

Discussion
The results suggest that even flexible nonlinear models struggle to extract reliable signal from daily equity returns.
This reinforces the importance of careful validation and skepticism toward apparent in sample performance. 
The project emphasizes empirical discipline over performance optimization.

Conclusion
This study provides a transparent evaluation of machine learning methods applied to asset pricing data. 
While predictive performance is limited, the results align with theoretical and empirical expectations and 
demonstrate a scalable research pipeline suitable for further extensions.
